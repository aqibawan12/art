    <div className="about-content">
      <p>
        <strong>Comrade Husnain (Husnain Jamil Faridi)</strong> is a Lahore-based Artist, Urdu calligrapher, Writer and political activist whose work sits at the intersection of art, ideology, and memory.

      <p>
        Husnain is a student of Ustaad Majnoo Painters from Pakpattan, and "Ustaad Ashraf Mirza" from Burewala under whom he trained in the old-school painter tradition of Urdu calligraphy. Unlike digitally influenced or institutionally trained artists, Comrade Husnain’s work draws deeply from street-painter aesthetics, shaped by generations of artists who wrote slogans, shop signs, and poetic lines by hand—making visual culture accessible to the people. His calligraphy bears the marks of that legacy: raw, expressive, and rooted in the land.

        Over the years, Comrade Husnain has won multiple calligraphy and writing competitions during his academic life and later served as a judge at various art competitions.

His artistic output carries a poetic, progressive, and political sensibility—speaking directly to the masses, not just about beauty, but about truth, dignity, and struggle.

      <h3>Why “Comrade”?</h3>
      <p>
        The word "Comrade" (a friend or trusted companion) is more than a title—it is a worldview. It signifies a belief in collective struggle, mutual respect, and revolutionary transformation. For Comrade Husnain, calligraphy is not an escape from politics, but an extension of it. His pen becomes a companion in the long journey toward equality, dignity, and liberation.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a growing social media reach in the millions, his handwritten work circulates widely among activists, artists, poets, students, and thinkers—both within Pakistan and across the Urdu-speaking diaspora. His art does not just preserve tradition; it revives it with purpose.
